A simple program that demonstrates C++ for problem solving a simple FizzBuzz test.

If the value of the iteration is divisible by 3, the program prints "Fizz".
If the value of the iteration is divisible by 3, the program prints "Buzz".
If the value of the iteration is divisible by 3 and 5, the program prints "FizzBuzz".

While there are so many people that answer this problem, I wanted to supply my own code into my github just to show my indentation style and brace usage.

As mentioned, it's simple. :)
